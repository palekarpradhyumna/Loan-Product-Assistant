A Personal Loan is a loan that can be availed for any personal purpose such as home renovation, wedding, medical emergencies, travelling, debt repayments, bill payments and more. Unlike other loans, Personal Loan does not require any collateral or security and can be easily availed with minimum documentation. Like any other loan, you can repay Personal Loan with EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments); debited from your bank account.
To avail the Personal Loan, all you need to do is submit the loan application form. On meeting the eligibility criteria, you will get an offer with the sanctioned amount, tenure of loan and interest rate. Once you accept the offer, funds are transferred to your bank account instantly.
You can use thePersonal Loan EMI Calculatorto know your EMI amount before applying for the Loan.
Funds from Personal Loan can be used to cater to requirements of meeting personal expenses.
You can repay your Personal Loan via an auto-debit instruction through your Bank account on a stipulated date every month to repay your EMI.Maha Bank Personal Loan scheme for Salaried customersFor Category Aa) Salary Account with Bank of Maharashtra - 84 monthsb) Salary Account with Other Bank - 60 monthsFor Category B & C60 monthsMaha Bank Personal Loan scheme for Professionals60 monthsBank Personal Loan scheme - for Business Class having Home Loan with us84 months
